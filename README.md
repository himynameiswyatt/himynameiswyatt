Hi, my name is Wyatt ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m interested in: 
music, traveling, science, human psycology, politics, health, and now coding.

Iâ€™m currently learning a little bit of everything, it seems.
As of now I'm focused on a front-end goal, but eventually I'd like to become a full-stack developer.

I don't personally know any other developers, so I'm always looking to meet individuals who share this new interest of mine.
